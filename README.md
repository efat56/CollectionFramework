# CollectionFramework
## It's all about collection

In Java, a collection is a group of objects or elements, similar to an array, but with additional functionality and flexibility. Collections are part of the Java Collections Framework, which provides a set of interfaces and classes to represent and manipulate collections of objects.

- There are several types of collections in Java, including:

List - An ordered collection of elements where duplicates are allowed.

Set - An unordered collection of unique elements.

Queue - An ordered collection of elements designed to hold elements prior to processing.

Map - A collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
